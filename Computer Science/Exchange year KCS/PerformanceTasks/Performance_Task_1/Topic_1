master (server)

The first bot nets on the internet used a client-server model to accomplish their tasks.
Typically, these bot nets operate through Internet Relay Chat networks, domains, or websites.
Infected clients access a predetermined location and await incoming commands from the server.
The bot herder sends commands to the server, which relays them to the clients.
Clients execute the commands and report their results back to the bot herder.
In the case of IRC bot nets,
infected clients connect to an infected IRC server and join a channel pre-designated for C&C by the bot herder.
The bot herder sends commands to the channel via the IRC server.
Each client retrieves the commands and executes them.
Clients send messages back to the IRC channel with the results of their actions.
