2.a
The language we programed in was Javascript.

The purpose was to give a number zero to four and draw stars.

When you open turtle and you type in 0-4 stars in random colors is what you will see.

2.b
We gave different jobs to each member. Andrea made the script for how many stars you would like. Kohdai made the process of drawing the star. I made the “for” loop for draw different stars.

2.d
function Kahla_Function(n) {
  for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  Kohdai_function();
  }
}
