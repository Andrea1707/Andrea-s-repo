Story of the stars Andrea Kahla Kohdai.

2a. Provide a written response that:
	● identifies the programming language:
		The programming language is Java Script.
	● identifies the purpose of your program:
		The purpose of our program is given a number between zero to four and draw stars.
	● and explains what the user should expect to see when they run the program.
		When you press on start the program ask how many squares do you want dray (number between 0 to 4) and
    with the turtle it will draw 1,2,3 or 4 stars in random colors.


2b . Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program, focusing on two distinct
points in that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities you encountered and how they were
resolved or incorporated. In your description clearly indicate whether the development described was
collaborative or independent. At least one of these points must refer to independent program development.

  We started tho give us different jobs. Kohdai made the process to draw a star, Kahla made the ‘for’
  loop for draw different stars and I made the script for ask how many stars you want.

2d . Capture and paste a program code segment that contains an abstraction you developed individually
  on your own (marked with a rectangle). This abstraction must integrate mathematical and logical concepts.
  Explain how your abstraction helped manage the complexity of your program.


function Andrea_Function() {
  do{
var n = prompt("How many stars?(Number between 0 and 4)", "");
}
while(n>4&&n>0);
Kahla_Function(n);

}
