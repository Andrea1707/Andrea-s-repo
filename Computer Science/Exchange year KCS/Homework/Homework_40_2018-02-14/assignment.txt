Spectre (security vulnerability)
Overview:
Spectre is a vulnerability that affects modern microprocessors that perform branch prediction.

  What is the branch prediction?
  In computer architecture, a branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch
  will go before this is known definitively. The purpose of the branch predictor is to
  improve the flow in the instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high effective performance
  in many modern pipelined microprocessor architectures such as x86.



On most processors, the speculative execution resulting from a branch misprediction may leave observable side effects that may
reveal private data to attackers. For example, if the pattern of memory accesses performed by such speculative execution depends
on private data, the resulting state of the data cache constitutes a side channel through which an attacker may be able to extract
information about the private data using a timing attack.

  What is a timing attack?
  In cryptography, a timing attack is a side channel attack in which the attacker attempts to compromise a cryptosystem by analyzing
  the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms. Every logical operation in a computer takes time to execute, and the time can
  differ based on the input; with precise measurements of the time for each operation, an attacker can work backwards to the input.

The Spectre bug was used in the Meltdown attack.
  Meltdown breaks the most fundamental isolation between user applications and the operating system.
  This attack allows a program to access the memory, and thus also the secrets, of other programs and
  the operating system.

  Whose data was lost / stolen / leaked? How many people / organizations were affected?

  We don't know yet if some virus or malware used this bug for stole data. We know all computer has this vulnerability.

How and How to Prevent
  Keep your OS always at the last version because the CPU companies and OS companies has been releasing update for fix this problem.

Data Specifics:
  it could be stole data like a password, credit card, personal information ecc..

Data Privacy / Security / Storage Concern:

An a Software programmer (Michael Schwarz) has developed a malware for show the Spectre bug using the Meltdown attack. (Video)
