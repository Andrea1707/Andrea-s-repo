 a) What is the network ID (bottom address in range of host IP addresses)
 b) What is the broadcast IP (top address in range of host IP addresses)
 c) What is the range of usable host IP addresses (addresses between a) and b) above)

10.45.200.76 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0
a)10.45.0.0
b)10.45.255.255
c)1 to 254

254.60.60.1 and subnet mask 255.255.0.0
a)
b)
c)

a)
b)
c)

2) What subnet mask will give 510 usable (when including network ID and
   broadcast ID address, it will be a total of 512 "neighbors")
   for the IP address:

   1.2.3.4
