1.I will use a pivot chart or grid chart to represent it. These patterns will show
the amount which is based on the information. If it does reach the amount danger, then
they can make their decision.
Each column in the chart or block will represent how many plotholes in each places in the city.
2.The only thing that could help people to understand easier is to make the chart based on the
simplest model for them. It's a block model ( pivot chart or grid chart). They don't need to
understand the technology, they can see the chart and understand the problem.
If the city has a lot of the people like a urban, I don't think the analysis of the data of the
scenario is astray. I think the city can identify the result of the analysis.Because they has enough people to look up
how many potholes does their city have and I think the analysis will be clearly.
If the city doesn't have a lot of the people like a countryside, I think the analysis is astray.
I think the city cannot identify the result. Because they don't have enough people
to look up how many potholes does they have and I think the analysis is not clearly like a scattered.
3. Yes. For this scenario, it assumes that everyone will report the potholes
when see it. It will affect how much potholes are reported.
But the data has to be updated before the fixing begins. All the data must be corrected.
If it doesn't follow the real life data, it's going to cost a lot amount of works.
Before making the final decision, we must update the location, the plotholes in the location,
the size, depth, how many of it.
