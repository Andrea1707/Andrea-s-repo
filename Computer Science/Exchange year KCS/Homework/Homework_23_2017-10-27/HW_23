1.  First visualization is the admit rate of top 20 liberal Arts colleges. We can see the
    admit rate of top 20 that colleges.
     Second one is the 4-yr grad.rate (which means percentage of students who attend
    the college and graduate in four year) of top 20 that colleges. we can see the

     Third one is the admit rate of top 20 that colleges vs the 4-yr grad.rate of
    that.
     Fourth one is the total cost per yr (which means cost of attendance for one
    academic year) of top 20 that colleges.

2.  First of all, most colleges are around 25% when looking at the admire rate.
    But there is only one very high rate college. it is Thomas Aquinas college.
    the admire rate of that college is like 80%. Why does that college have such
    a high percentage? Looking at 4-yr grad rate, most colleges have higher
    percentage. But only Thomas Aquinas college is lower one. Why does Thomas
    Aquinas college have a different rate from other college? Looking at the
    total cost per yr of top 20 liberal Arts colleges, Thomas Aquinas college is
    about 30,000 dollars a yr. but most colleges are about 60,000 dollars a yr.
    So it is easier for someone to enter to that college, but that college has
    many dropout student because of the cheaper cost a yr.
