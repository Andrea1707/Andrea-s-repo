Students will work in 2-3 member group on one of the datasets. Each student
needs to submit a full copy of the assignment in their own student repo

Provide written (in a text file in your student repo) answers to the 3 questions
at the end of the pdf

On Friday, we'll review in class each group's submissions. This will be informal
and not require students to present in front of the class, just make informal
questions and answers as we review their results.
